This is the uncompiled source code for [Plausible Thought](http://plausiblethought.net), the personal blog of [Marc Jenkins](http://www.marcjenkins.co.uk). 

Plausible Thought is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and my SASS toolkit [Origin](https://github.com/marcjenkins/Origin-Static).

You can read more about the Plausible Thought [here](http://plausiblethought.net/about/).
